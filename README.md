# Library project frontend
A frontend side for a project for Kodilla java developer course

Link to backend: https://github.com/JabAlex/Library-project-backend

### Project not complete!
Still to do:
- add an administration panel(right now adding, editing books and movies is possible through api calls)
- fix frontend not updating when data changes on backend

### Project set up instructions are on backend side repository
